# regression analysis_paper.py
This pyhton script uses the above listed input files to perform and evaluate a regression analysis of the CT data against the laboratory data. The regression result is the composition of the CT-derived sediment phases (A,B) in terms of pore ice, organic, and mineral. The script furthermore computes evaluation metrics of the lab-CT comparison, and computes volumetric contents of pore ice, total ice, organic, and mineral at the high resolution of the original CT data.

# volumetric_contents_sampleRes_lab+CT.csv
Contains the volumetric contents of total ice, organic, and mineral measured in the laboratory at AWI Potsdam at a coarse resolution. It further contains the volumetric contents of gas, excess ice, and two sediment phases (A,B) derived from a CT scan at UFZ Halle, downsampled to the resolution of the laboratory samples.

# volumetric_contents_highRes_CT.csv
Contains the volumetric contents of gas, excess ice, and two sediment phases (A,B) derived from a CT scan at UFZ Halle at the original resolution of 50Âµm.

# volumetric_contents_sampleRes_all.csv
This file can be reproduced by the files listed above and contains, in addition to the data contained in volumetric_contents_sampleRes_lab+CT.csv, the volumetric contents of pore ice, total ice, mineral, and organic as predicted by the regression model at the same (coarse) resolution as the laboratory samples.

# volumetric_contents_highRes_all.csv
This file can be reproduced by the files listed above and contains, in addition to the data contained in volumetric_contents_highRes_CT.csv, the volumetric contents of pore ice, total ice, mineral, and organic as predicted by the regression model at the same (high) resolution as the original CT data.
